## What is an UByte
A UByte file is a data file contaning unsigned bytes. It can be used to save and load datasets.

The UByte file structure was described and used by Yann LeCun, to create the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The magic of the files is the header. In the header of the file it is possible to differentiate image files from label files, the number of items in the file, the number of rows, and the number of columns.
